### Investigation

**You own the answer. Plan, route, write.**

Read-only requests: "how does X work?", "why was Y built this way?", "are we sure about Z?", "should we do X or Y?". They produce a cited explanation or a recommendation, not a code change.

1. Route through the **how** skill (Explain mode for narrow questions, Critique mode for "are we sure?"). For motivation questions, also route through the **why** skill. For "should we do X or Y?", run how on each option's current shape, then recommend with a tradeoffs table.
2. Throughput checkpoint stays one line: `throughput checkpoint: n/a, read-only investigation`.
3. Produce the `how`-shaped output (Overview / Key Concepts / How It Works / Where Things Live / Gotchas), or a recommendation with a tradeoffs table if the request is a decision between alternatives.
4. Apply the **unslop** skill to the reply. Mark `skip: not shipped` and write short sentences anyway.

No PR unless asked. If the investigation precedes a code change, hand back to the user and re-route to Work.

Playbook delegates omit Task `model`.

**Reply:** the investigation output. For "are we sure?" and "should we do X or Y?" answers, include your real judgment with reasons.
